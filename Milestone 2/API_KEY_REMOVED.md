# ‚úÖ API Key Removed Successfully

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Action:** Removed Google API key from `.env` file  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## What Was Done

### üîí Security Action Taken:

**Removed API key from:**
```
/workspaces/AI-Based-Real-Estate-Valuation-System/Milestone 2/.env
```

**Previous (REMOVED):**
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDdRnm4TfjvhUV77KaM6RIifn3xGE_lAP4
```

**Current (SECURE):**
```
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
# Instructions provided in file
```

## Application Status

### ‚úÖ Application Still Working:

**What Still Works:**
- ‚úÖ Streamlit app running on http://0.0.0.0:8501
- ‚úÖ ML model predictions (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- ‚úÖ EMI Calculator
- ‚úÖ Financial calculations
- ‚úÖ All core features

**What Uses Fallback Content:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Gemini AI features (Market Analysis, Investment Recommendations, etc.)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Professional fallback content is displayed automatically
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Users still get quality responses, just not AI-generated

---

## Current Application Behavior

### Without API Key:

```
‚úì Application starts successfully
‚úì ML predictions work perfectly
‚úì No errors or crashes
‚úì Gemini AI features show professional fallback content
‚úì User experience remains smooth
```

**From the logs:**
```
INFO - ML model predictions working normally
WARNING - Could not extract valid response from Gemini AI, using fallback content
```

This is **expected behavior** - the enhanced error handling we implemented ensures the application works gracefully even without an API key!

   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Restart the app:**
